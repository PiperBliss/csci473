## Installing VMware

VMware Workstation Player for Windows and Linux is free for non commercial use:

VMware Fusion for OSX is free for non-commercial use (works on x86 and M1/M2 chips as well).

You may need to create an account with your CCU email address, and verify that you're doing this for personal use / non-commercial use.

After installing, you can then download your favorite flavor of linux, for example Ubuntu, and then install it inside of VMware.  You'll want to get the ".ISO" version of the downloads.  Look for tutorials about how to do this if you'd like.

## OSX -- working with MPI, etc 
If you want to work with linux-like commands and apps that may not already be part of what is installed on your mac, use Homebrew to manage these.  Goto:

https://brew.sh

Follow the directions there.  After installing Homebrew, install openmpi for Mac by
